### Gallagher & Associates Front End Assessment

For animating the components of this project, I used standard CSS transitions and animations dictated by state.
I went with standard CSS animations because that is what I know best, however to properly utilize the React Transition Group
methods, I could have used a CSS-in-JS library such as Glamorous or Radium. If I had more time to play around with UX and UI design
I could've also used those methods to animate in specific elements of the scene on scene Entered, and animate them out on scene Exit or Exited. 
Or I woul've used a library such as velocity-react to add specific animation on component enter or exit, which I believe would've taken less lines to write than using React 
Transition Group.

It took me quite a bit of time to finish this project because I spent too much time on experimenting with various different animations and styles. 
If I had an already established animation sequence to go from, it would've taken me a lot less time to do, since I tend to get
caught up in the animation experimentation stage.
