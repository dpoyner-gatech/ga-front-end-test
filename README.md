## Gallagher & Associates â€” Front End Assessment

### Setup
The url for development is hosted on [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/r0r02z9w9n). Developers should login to their github account and fork the sandbox (located in the top left of the CodeSandbox UI).

The code is structured using OOP and dependencies [React](http://reactjs.org) and [React-Transition-Group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/). Developer's are free to add additional dependencies at their discretions

### Objectives
The developer should create two scenes which transition. There is a JSON object containing information on 5 presidents in the `/data` folder. The first scene will be an **Attract** which should have a passive animation and proceed to the next seen on a **PointerDown Event**.

The **Gallery** scene will be an interactive element which displays the presidential data. The gallery should animate in nicely and be able to go back to the attract after a certain period of inactivity. 

All interactivity is up to the developer. It could be a slideshow, a zoom/pan experience or an interactive canvas. It is up to the developer to provide a creative solution with a solid user experience.

### Notes
Developer's have free reign on the architecture and structure of the application. The provided code is similar to our web applications. Code will be assessed based on legibility, creativity and organization. Bonus points are giving for using advanced rendering engines such as [PIXI](http://pixijs.io) and [THREE.js](http://threejs.org). Smooth animation and interactivity are important and should be highly considered when implementing transitions and creating the gallery.

Applications will not be judged on design (it helps if it looks nice), responsiveness and load time (based on asset size). Also, the applications build target is Google Chrome. G&A is not concerned with cross-browser capabilities at the moment.

### Completion
The task should be completed within a reasonable timeframe. A few hours should be enough to create a simple animation sequence with basic interactivity. Please note the hours it took to complete. If it takes longer than a few hours than the results should be more impressive. If the developer finds that to be too short an amount of time then the developers should take note and commit what they have up until that point.

Developer's will create a pull request on completion. They will need to use the Github icon located on the left side of the screen. The pull request should be **[Developer's last name]-complete** (i.e. Smith-complete).

**Good Luck! We look forward to seeing what you come up with!**
